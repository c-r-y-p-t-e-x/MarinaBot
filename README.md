# MarinaBot
MarinaBot is a Discord bot that uses discord.js. She is licensed under GPL for any and all usage, just be sure to include me and other contributors in any edits made, as I have.

#Installation
As of now, you need to download the zip file from here, and install node.js and discord.js separately. I hope to fix and automate everything in the near future.

#Setting up Marina
There are 7 settings you'll need to edit in settings.json, as well as auth.json. auth.json is self-explanatory. But the others.....

#Usage
Be sure MarinaBot is already on your server (AKA joined) before anything else. Edit the auth.json and settings.json files to your liking, then simply run "node MarinaBot.js". If everything has been set up correctly, you'll get a message with how many channels MarinaBot is serving.

#Advanced
TODO: Explain AI setup through PandoraBots.

#PSO2 EQ Alerts Status
As of now, MarinaBot will auto-alert for any PSO2 EQs, but won't do her other commands, such as !checkeq, !previouseq, or !currenteq. I also hope to include a calendar function for scheduled EQs, but that may be a little much for MarinaBot right now.

#Marina's Future
There's a LOT of functionality that I'm leaving out right now, such as the Google Image plugin, Wikipedia plugin, and others. I hope to add a few more items to settings.json and include the plugins, with an ability to disable them. I'll also be adding back the ability to add commands on the fly, including full functionality. If you look at the commands.js file, you'll see what I mean. I also intend to add admin and superuser files so that only certain people can run certain commands. As of now, so long as MarinaBot has the ability, anyone, and I mean ANYONE, can add or delete a channel. Not good.

#Marina's Past
If you've seen my previous version of Marina, she has definitely come a long way from a simple pingpong bot. I added many little things, like !rules and !symbols, and even the ever so wonderful "SHAKE SHAKE" that everyone enjoyed.
